# Play Integrity Fix-NEXT
Originally created by chiteroman, forked by me. This module is a set of experimental items to ensure valid attestation on rooted devices with the new PlayIntegrity API rules and DroidGuard restrictions. Avaliable on Android 10-16.

## Required
First, install one of these TrickyStore versions:
- [TrickyStore](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore/releases)
- [TrickyStore-OSS](https://github.com/beakthoven/TrickyStoreOSS/releases)

You must have **one** of the following combinations installed (use latest versions):

| Root Solution | Zygisk Implementation | Additional Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) | [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) or [ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Disable Zygisk in Magisk settings |
| [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU) | [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) or [ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk) | Install as module |
| [KernelSU Next](https://github.com/KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next) | [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) or [ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk) | Install as module |
| [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) | [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) or [ReZygisk](https://github.com/PerformanC/ReZygisk) | Install as module |


## üìù NOTES
PIF-Next is not a root hiding module. It only has integration with TrickyStore to ensure valid hardware attestation and predefined settings to guarantee stable and excellent usability for later configuration.

## üîç CHECK INTEGRITY

There are two reliable methods for verifying Play Integrity verdicts:

1. **Google Play Store**:
   - Open the Play Store > Settings > Tap ‚ÄòPlay Store version‚Äô seven times.
   - Go to ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô > ‚ÄòDeveloper options‚Äô > ‚ÄòVerify integrity‚Äô.
   - Your attestation will appear immediately!

2. **External app - SPIC**:
   - Download [SPIC - Play Integrity Checker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.henrikherzig.playintegritychecker&pcampaignid=web_share).
   - Open the app and click ‚ÄòCheck‚Äô to view the results.


After requesting an attestation, you should receive something like this:
```text
- MEETS_BASIC_INTEGRITY     ‚úÖ
- MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY    ‚úÖ
- MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY    ‚ùå (available with valid keybox)
- MEETS_VIRTUAL_INTEGRITY   ‚ùå (only for emulators)
```


## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES
- Google Wallet: there is no magic formula that makes GWallet work on all devices. By default, PIF-Next comes with all options enabled and configured to ensure compatibility.
- Conflicts: some Custom ROMs (e.g. CrDroid, InfinityX, Matrixx, etc.) already come with Keybox injection by default. Instead of using this module, you can just use TrickyStore + Keybox injection from your own ROM.
