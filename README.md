## ‚úÖ How to Check Veredicts
After flashing PIF Next, you can check your verdicts using:
- [Play Integrity API Checker (PlayStore)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.nikolasspyr.integritycheck&pli=1)
*or by enabling Developer Options in the Play Store by going to **Settings** > **About **> Click 5x on **‚ÄúPlay Store Version‚Äù**, then go to **‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô** >** ‚ÄúDeveloper Options‚Äù **and click on **‚ÄúCheck Integrity‚Äù**.*

NOTICE: If you encounter a limit error message, try using a different app. This issue occurs due to high demand for attestation requests from many users.

After requesting an attestation, expect the following outcomes:

    Basic Integrity: ‚úÖ Passed
    Device Integrity: ‚úÖ Passed
    Strong Integrity: ‚úÖ Passed (under certain conditions).
    Virtual Integrity: ‚ùå Not Passed (applies only to emulators)
